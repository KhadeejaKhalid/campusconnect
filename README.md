### Project Description
CampusConnect is a centralized platform designed to help students manage their academic life in one place. It provides a smart dashboard with upcoming labs, timetable schedules, and a forum for anonymous doubts, making college organization simple, clear, and stress-free.

### The Problem statement
Students face confusion and stress because academic information like timetables, lab deadlines, and doubts are scattered across multiple platforms, leading to missed updates and poor organization.

### The Solution
We solve this by centralizing all academic information—timetables, lab deadlines, and doubts—into one organized dashboard with reminders and an anonymous forum, making everything easy to track in one place.
